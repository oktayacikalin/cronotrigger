Fast backup tool for Ubuntu 12.04+ based distros (like ElementaryOS, Linux Mint etc.) using Python 2.7/3.3.

Goals are:
* Scan as fast as possible (using harmless tricks).
* Backup as much as possible.
* Backup as fast as possible (using multi threading).
* Rebuild same files as hard links (like time machine etc.).
* Keep the footprint as low as possible (don't hog cpu/ram, let the harddrives sweat).
* Stay out of the way but still provide meaningful logging.
* Provide a nice simple GUI.

Let's see if this works out! :)
